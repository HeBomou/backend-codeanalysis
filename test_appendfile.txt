Welcome to Code Analysis by Happy6+
First let's go through checkpoint 2, 4 and 5.

Please input the path to your project: ---------Init---------
Your project has been loaded successfully.
Edge: 2
Vertex: 3
ConnectiveDomain (excluding domains with only one vertex): 1
----------------------

Please input the closeness threshold: -------Threshold------
Number of connective domains in inital graph (excluding domains with only one vertex): 1
Set closeness threshold 1.0
Number of connective domains after setting threshold (not including domain with only one vertex): 0
----------------------
Do you want to show vertices of each domain? (y/N) 
Follow the instruction and search the shortest path.
Please input source vertex[class/method name]
There is no vertex matching your input.

The check is finished, then you can try our interactive program. (y/N)
